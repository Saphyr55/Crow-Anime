She is 4 or 5 years old, but claims to be 6 so that Loid will adopt her. Originally an experimental human test subject dubbed &quot;Subject 007,&quot; she escaped because she was disgusted with a life where she could not behave like a child. In addition, because she has not received a proper education, she is not good with studying but makes up for it by reading other peoples'' minds for answers. She likes spy anime and thinks anything involving &quot;secrets&quot; and &quot;missions&quot; are exciting.');
