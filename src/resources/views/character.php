            <p>The secretary of the Shuchiin Academy student council. She's been friends with Shinomiya since middle school. She's ditzy and likes to gossip, and often throws a wrench in Shinomiya and Shirogane's plans due to her unpredictability. Even so, she's quite a bit more well-adjusted than her fellow student council members and sometimes takes it upon herself to teach them how to overcome their shortcomings.</p>
